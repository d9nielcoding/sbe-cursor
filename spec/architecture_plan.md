### API Caching Strategy

To improve performance and user experience, we've designed the following API caching strategy using SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate):

#### API Calls to Cache

| API Call | Description | Stale Time | Cache Duration | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| `getBlockBySlot` | Block details by slot number | Infinity | 24 hours | Historical block data doesn't change after confirmation |
| `getTransactionsFromBlock` | Transactions in a block | Infinity | 24 hours | Transaction lists are immutable once confirmed |
| `getTransactionBySignature` | Transaction details | Infinity | 24 hours | Transaction details don't change after confirmation |
| `getSlotLeader` | Block producer details | Infinity | 24 hours | Slot leader assignment is permanent |
| `getRecentBlocks` | Recent block list | 30 seconds | 5 minutes | Needs periodic updates but not real-time |

#### Caching Strategy Considerations

1. **Conditional Caching**
   - Longer cache times for confirmed blocks/transactions (>32 confirmations)
   - Shorter cache times for recent, potentially unconfirmed data

2. **Cache Size Management**
   - Implement maximum cache items limit (e.g., 500 blocks/transactions)
   - Use LRU (Least Recently Used) policy for cache eviction

3. **Error Handling**
   - Return cached data on error (even if stale)
   - Implement sensible retry strategies

4. **User Controls**
   - Provide manual refresh buttons for forcing data updates
   - Clear indicator when viewing cached vs. fresh data

#### Implementation Plan

1. Install and configure SWR library
2. Create custom hooks for each API call type with appropriate cache settings
3. Replace current `useEffect`-based data fetching with SWR hooks
4. Add cache invalidation triggers where appropriate
5. Implement cache debugging and monitoring tools

#### Future Caching Improvements

1. **LocalStorage Persistence**:
   - Implement SWR persistence using `localStorage` to retain cache between sessions
   - Add cache expiration timestamps for different data types

2. **Cache Size Control**:
   - Implement custom size limits by data type
   - Add monitoring tools to track cache usage

3. **Cache Warming**:
   - Pre-fetch common queries on application startup
   - Implement smart prediction of next blocks to cache

4. **Cache Invalidation Triggers**:
   - Automated invalidation when new blocks arrive
   - User-triggered global refresh

## Performance Benchmarking & Measurement
